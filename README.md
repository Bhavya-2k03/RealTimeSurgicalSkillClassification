#3D CNN-based deep learning model for surgical skill assessment.  

1.) Random consecutive video frames are chosen from a Surgery video at a frequency of 30 Hz for 3
seconds and are passed through a 3D CNN for spatial as well as temporal feature extraction.  

2.) The model achieves a competitive accuracy of 100% on knot tying and 97.2% on Suturing Task.
